# Genetic-best-algebraic-tree-algorithm
Algebraic expression in tree form with algorithm for finding best matching tree for given file with tuple: x - arg, y - arg, result.

For example
Given

 x      y     f(x,y)
2.4    3.5     18.2
4.0   -2.7      9.3
.
.
.
11.3   9.3     21.45

for that given input, using genetic programming, program is going to try to match best function (tree representation) that satisfies the given data.
